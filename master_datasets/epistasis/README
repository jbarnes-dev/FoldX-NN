Epistasis set singles is the single mutations which are part of the epistasis dataset. This is 12.6% of the total singles dataset. 

singles_no_epistasis is the singles data sans data with epistasis. 

The intention is to then build a model where the epistasis set is part of the test set. Thus the train:test split for this model would be 0.084 to then be combined with the epistasis subset. Then final predictions can be made and set aside. 

Furthermore runs of double mutations will then have predictions involving any of the double mutations set aside to then evaluate epistasis performance. This gets a bit tricky with the variation between runs.
